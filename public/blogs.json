      "content": "Okay so I pretty much have to think about my New Year's resolutions right now. So I think this was a pretty good year, it was pretty solid. I didn't really think there's a lot to be proud of this year.\n\nAt the beginning of it, I did a lot of working and a lot of building. Here's what I learned:\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Consistency beats intensity** - Showing up every day matters more than occasional bursts of effort\n- **Build in public** - Sharing progress keeps you accountable and connects you with others\n- **Focus on fundamentals** - The basics never go out of style\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nFor 2025, I want to focus on:\n\n1. Writing more consistently\n2. Finishing projects instead of starting new ones\n3. Reading more books\n\nLet's see how it goes."
